# pedalshield-mega-kicad

Native KiCAD files for ElecroSmash PedalShield MEGA.

The purpose for this repository is to reconstruct the source files for the PCB, so it is easier to modify and generate gerber files for PCB manufacture.

Libraries and Modules have been added to the repo to keep it as self contained as possible and the project _should_ load with no errors on KiCAD 6.0.

Please feel free to fork and submit pull requests if you see any room of improvement because I am not really an electronics engineer, I am learning as I go.

Enjoy!
